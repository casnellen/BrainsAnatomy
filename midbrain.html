	  <h2> Midbrain </h2>
	    <p>The midbrain is the superior most portion of the brainstem that is concerned with important functions such as motor movement and auditory and visual processing.</p>
	    <h3> Tectum </h3>
	      <p>The tectum is the posterior portion of the midbrain with two main subsections, superior and inferior colliculi.</p>
	      <h4> Superior Colliculi</h4> 
		<p> The superior colliculi participates mainly in visual reflexes, such as tracking objects in the visual field, by using information passed from the retina and visual cortex.</p>
	      <h4> Inferior Colliculi </h4> 
		<p> The inferior colliculi is a relay station for auditory fibers from the temporal lobe to connect with the auditory section of the thalamus.</p>
	    <h3> Tegmentum </h3>
	      <p>The tegmentum is located anterior to the tectum within the midbrain. It is mainly comprised of fiber tracts and has three main subsections: the red nucleus, substantia nigra, and the periaqueductal gray. </p>
	      <h4> Red Nucleus </h4> 
		<p> The red nucleus is the medial most part of the tegmentum and is involved with the coordination of sensorimotor information. </p>
	      <h4> Substantia Nigra </h4> 
		<p> The substantia nigra is located in the anterior portion of the tegmentum and is primarily involved with reward and movement. </p>
	      <h4> Periaquductul gray </h4> 
		<p>The periaqueductul is a cluster of neurons that are located around cerebral aqueduct within the tegmentum. Itâ€™s primary function is the primary control center for descending pain modulation. </p>
	    <h3> Basal Ganglia </h3>
	      <p>The basal ganglia is a group of nuclei that are located at the base of the midbrain, with one of the nuclei being the substantia nigra. The basal ganglia participate in action selection (deciding which of several possible actions to execute at any given time). It also helps in making sure that voluntary movement is executed in a smooth fashion. </p>
