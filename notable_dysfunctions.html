	  <h2> Notable Dysfunctions </h2>
	    <h3> Epilepsy </h3>
	      <p>Epilepsy is a central nervous system disorder that causes seizures, periods of abnormal behavior, sensations, and loss of awareness in the affected individual. The seizures are caused when neurons have a misfire while communicating which will cause a chemical imbalance within the brain. This chemical imbalance will disturb the electrical balance within the brain which causes the the changes in the individual when a seizure occurs. </p>

	    <h3> Broca's Aphasia (Expressive Aphasia) </h3>
	      <p>Broca’s aphasia is the loss of someone’s ability to form coherent speech. It usually occurs after someone has had a stroke that damaged part or all of Broca’s area (the area concerned with the motor production of speech). It is also known as expressive aphasia because most patients with this type of aphasia cannot form speech or write but most retain their ability to understand spoken and written language. </p>

	    <h3> Wernicke's Aphasia (Receptive Aphasia) </h3>
	      <p>Wernicke’s aphasia is closely related to Broca’s because it has the inverse symptoms of Broca’s aphasia. Patients who are affected by wernicke’s aphasia have trouble understanding both written and spoken language, hence why it is also called receptive aphasia. Many people will experience a symptom known as “word salad”, this is where they are forming comprehendable words but the sentences that are formed have no actual meaning to them. This aphasia is usually brought on when damage to Wernicke’s area (the area concerned with speech comprehension) has happened.</p>

	    <h3> Blindsight </h3>
	      <p>Blindsight is an interesting form of blindness that isn’t caused by any deformation within the eye itself. Someone with blindsight can physically see the world around them but due to some sort of region in the primary visual cortex, they cannot process the visual information therefore rendering them legally blind. Interestingly enough, someone with blindsight has the ability to respond to visual stimuli that they don’t actually “see”. Researchers conducted a study where they placed a patient with blindsight in front of an obstacle course in an hallway and asked the patient to navigate through the hallway. The patient was actually able to successfully navigate through the course even though they couldn’t actually see any of the objects around them.</p>

	    <h3> Visual Neglect </h3>
	      <p>Visual neglect is another visual disorder that is not caused by any problems within the eyes themselves. Visual neglect is primarily caused by a lesion on one hemisphere of the brain within the frontal lobe and ultimately affects what the person pays attention to. For example, if a patient has a lesion a certain part of the right hemisphere of the frontal lobe, the patient will lose the ability to pay attention to anything in the left visual field. This means that the patient will typically fail to eat food on the left side of their plate, not acknowledge people they know that are standing to the left of them, or not shave the left side of their face.</p>

	    <h3> Prosopagnosia </h3>
	      <p>Prosopagnosia, also known as face blindness, is a disorder in which a patient cannot recognize faces. This disorder usually presents itself when damage (either trauma or birth defect) has occurred in the FFA. Someone with this disorder can have a spectrum of symptoms such as only having trouble recognizing familiar face to not being able to distinguish a face from an object. It is interesting to note that there is some degree of prosopagnosia present in children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).</p>

	    <h3> Parkinson's </h3>
	      <p>Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurological disorder that degrades a person’s motor functions. This disorder slowly kills the dopamine cells in the basal ganglia (specifically the substantia nigra) causing tremors, slowed movement, rigid muscles, and other such motor issues.</p>

	    <h3> Alzheimer's </h3>
	      <p>Alzheimer’s is another degenerative neurological disorder that mainly affects a person’s memory but also can affect other cognitive abilities.  Alzheimer’s is caused by brain cells within the memory slowly dying over time. The degradation starts within the entorhinal cortex and progressive more into the outermost layers of the cerebral cortex. The symptoms of alzheimer’s usually begin with forgetting current events and conversations and will usually end with the patient being unable to remember to complete necessary body requirements such as drinking water and using the restroom. Alzheimer’s will usually affect memories in a retrograde fashion meaning that newer memories will be forgotten first before older memories such as childhood memories will be forgotten last. This is thought to happen because it is hypothesized that older memories are stored further away from the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex than newer memories are. Alzheimer’s also can only be officially diagnosed when an autopsy has been performed after the patient has passed away.</p>
