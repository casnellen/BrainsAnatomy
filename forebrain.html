	  <h2> Forebrain </h2>
	    <img src = "./pictures/forebrain.png" alt = "a picture of a brain that highlights the forebrain" width = "250" height = "200">
	    <p> The forebrain is one of the three main regions of the brain. All subregions of the frontal lobe play a central role in the processing of information related to our higher functions such as sensory and associative functions, voluntary motor movements, future planning, decision making, impulse control, and many other complex cognitive abilities. The forebrain has two main sub-sections: the cerebrum (the outer cortex) and the diencephalon (the inner cortex). </p>
	    <h3> Cerebrum </h3>
	      <img src = "./pictures/cerebrum.png" alt = "a picture of a brain that highlights the cerebrum" width = "250" height = "200">
  	      <p> The cerebrum, or as many people know it the cerebral cortex, is the outer cortex of the forebrain that plays a central role in developing the human consciousness.It is split into four different lobes that are responsible for processing different types of sensory information.  </p>
	      <h4> Frontal Lobe </h4> 
		<img src = "./pictures/frontal_lobe.png" alt = "a picture of a brain that highlights the frontal lobe" width = "250" height = "200">
	        <p> The <dfn>frontal lobe </dfn> is the most anterior lobe of the brain and sits right above the eyes. The frontal lobe was the last area in the brain to develop and the complexity of it is correlated to the advancedness of a certain species. The frontal lobe is responsible for many high functioning processes such as future planning, impulse control, decision-making and many other complex functions. Some of the more interesting areas of the frontal lobe are <em>the primary motor cortex </em>, <em> premotor cortex </em>, and <em> Broca's area </em>. </p>
			<h5> Primary Motor Cortex </h5>
		  <img src = "./pictures/primary_motor_cortex.png" alt = "a picture of a brain that highlights the primary motor cortex" width = "250" height = "200">
	          <p> The <dfn> primary motor cortex </dfn> is the area of the frontal lobe that controls the execution of most voluntary movements and is located in the posterior part of the frontal lobe. All body parts are represented somatotopically in the cortex -- i.e the fingers are next to the hand which is next to the arm etc. </p>
			<h5> Premotor Cortex </h5>
		  <img src = "./pictures/premotor_cortex.png" alt = "a picture of a brain that highlights the premotor cortex" width = "250" height = "200">

	          <p> The <dfn> entorhinal cortex </dfn> is the main gateway between the hippocampus and neocortex for the formation of long term memory. </p>
	      <h4> Parietal Lobe </h4>
		<img src = "./pictures/parietal_lobe.png" alt = "a picture of a brain that highlights the parietal lobe" width = "250" height = "200">
	        <p> The <dfn> parietal lobe </dfn> is positioned posterior to the frontal lobe and superior to the temporal lobes. The parietal lobe receives and processes sensory information from all around the body. One interesting area of the parietal is the <em>somatosensory cortex</em>.</p>
			<h5> Somatosensory Cortex </h5> 
		  <img src = "./pictures/somatosensory.png" alt = "a picture of a brain that highlights the somatosensory cortex" width = "250" height = "200">
	          <p> The <dfn> somatosensory cortex </dfn> is an area in the parietal lobe that is responsible for processing touch sensation. Much like the primary motor cortex the sensations from the body parts are represented somatotopically.  </p>
	      <h4> Occipital Lobe </h4> 
		<img src = "./pictures/occipital_lobe.png" alt = "a picture of a brain that highlights the occipital lobe" width = "250" height = "200">
